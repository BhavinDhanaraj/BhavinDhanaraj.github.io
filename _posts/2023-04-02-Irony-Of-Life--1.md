I wrote a lot about death while I had to live,
now I write about the beauty of life in the deathbed.

after asking the kids I meet , the silly questions that I was being asked when I was kid , I realise I've become old.

வேடிக்கையாக விளையாடிக்கொண்டு இருக்கும் குழந்தையை வேடிக்கை பார்த்துக்கொண்டு இருக்கும் என் வாழ்க்கை வேடிக்கையாக இருக்கிறது.


seeing you cry for him makes me  cry, not feeling your sadness but realising that it's not for me.

reality haunts more than the dreams.

I'd be happy to die while you are still in love with me, even if you weren't in real life.


the guy sitting in the seat never feels the pain of the person standing just like the person standing doesn't know the pain of waiting for a bus.

the desperate need for something lasts only until we either get it or lose it completely.

i feel more lonely seeing you than being alone. 




the pillow under the head yearns for the hug while the cuddling pillow yearns for the face.

from writing poems thinking of you to writing to stop thinking about you.

your eyes never lie but your eyebrows do.
