# The Man Who Couldn’t Sleep When It Was Dark

*Somewhere in the deserts of Rajasthan*

In a small room with two beds, a boy lay awake on one of them.

“Seventy… sixty-nine… sixty-eight… sixty-seven… sixty-six… sixty-five… sixty-four—ah, a mosquito bit me—sixty-one… six—no, this is not working.”

Kevin yelled, but no sound left his mouth. Everything happened inside his head.

He tried thinking about life instead. This had become a daily phenomenon now.

*Maybe I should try dating again. Or maybe not,* he thought.  
He hadn’t been in a relationship for the past two years. The only excuse he could offer himself was that he didn’t feel love anymore. In fact, he hardly felt many human emotions at all.

*Maybe I should multiply two three-digit numbers,* he told himself. *That should work.*

After some thought, he chose **378** and **751**.

He began multiplying them in his head. His face reddened. The funny thing was, the last time he had done three-digit multiplication was three years ago — and even then, with pen and paper.

Multiplying the ones place was easy.  
Seven times 378.

Then came the five. Carrying numbers. Remembering values. His brain began to ache.

He arrived at an answer somehow. He badly wanted to verify it, but he couldn’t.

Kevin closed his eyes, then opened them again.

The room was pitch dark. Cold air from the air conditioner brushed against his skin. Beside him, his uncle slept deeply on the other bed.

Kevin lay with his eyes wide open.

Ironically, everyone tried to sleep by closing their eyes. Kevin couldn’t sleep *because* his eyes were open. He couldn’t sleep without light. The reason was unknown — even to him.

The math had exhausted him, but sleep still refused to come.

All his senses registered was darkness, cold air, and the gentle whirring of the fan.

He tried concentrating on his body — his feet, then his legs. He listened closely to the fan. He focused on the taste on his tongue. Nothing worked.

He wished he had brought his usual night lamp. Somehow, he had forgotten it. His phone was dead.

There were no options left.

They had gone to bed at eleven. Barely an hour had passed. He still had almost six hours to survive before morning light.

Then a crazy idea entered his mind.

What if he imagined a light source?

He closed his eyes and tried to picture the sun. No matter how hard he tried, all he saw was darkness. Pitch black.

“This isn’t working,” he thought. *I want light. I’m willing to do anything for it.*

With his eyes open, he began searching the room.

It was compact: two cots, a bero with clothes inside, a couple of bags filled with books. Nothing else.

He moved using only his sense of touch.

First, he considered taking his uncle’s phone — but it was under the pillow his uncle slept on. That was impossible.

He tried opening the bero silently. Just clothes.

Then his leg struck something wooden.

He bent down. There was a small gap beneath the bero. He slid his hand under and felt several wooden pieces — logs, mostly used for campfires.

*Who keeps firewood in a scorching desert?* he thought.

And then it hit him.

Fire.

If he could make a fire, he could have light. And with light, he could sleep.

As crazy as it sounded, it was the only idea he had.

He gathered two wooden pieces and searched for something to light them. Nothing.

He remembered an old method — creating fire by rotating one piece of wood against another.

Even a spark would be enough. Better than nothing.

He tried shaping the wood by feel. He tore a small piece from his vest and wrapped it around the spindle. He pressed it into a dent on the flat board and began twisting rapidly.

His hands hurt. Sweat formed. He kept going.

Then his grip slipped.

The wooden spindle flew across the room and struck his uncle’s forehead.

**Bang.**

“Aaahhh!” his uncle yelled — a sharp, startled cry pulled from sleep.

Kevin immediately jumped back onto his bed and shut his eyes.

The light flicked on.

His uncle stood up, panicked. He checked the time — **1:34 a.m.** He opened his camera and examined his forehead. A small scrape. Blood trickled slightly.

He opened the bero and noticed the wooden pieces scattered below.

With a confused shake of his head, he spat into his hand, pressed a handkerchief against the wound, and tied it around his forehead.

He checked the camera again.

**1:48 a.m.**

He placed the phone on the table between the two beds, turned off the lights, and lay back down.

Kevin’s eyes remained closed.

But his hand slowly reached toward his uncle’s phone.
