### SLEEP EATING DEMON - 1. THE NIGHT THAT WOULD NOT END

![Spirit of sacred groves](/assets/posts/themanwhostayedawake/IMG_20251129_013938.jpg)


The breeze outside our house always carried the smell of wet soil and coconut husk, like the earth was breathing softly in its sleep.
Inside, my sister and I were doing what we always did at night when Appa wasn’t around —
annoying each other until one of us screamed first.



She had stolen my pillow.
I had stolen her blanket.
Both of us pretended to be offended.

It was stupid and childish and somehow the purest thing in our little universe.

When she swung the pillow at me, I ducked and laughed.
When I pushed her lightly, she pushed harder, because she always had to win.
And in that tiny playful war, I never saw the edge of the wooden table coming.

The sound of her head hitting the corner felt like something tearing inside me.

Everything after that moved too fast —
her gasp, the way her hands reached for me, the thin line of red across her forehead
and my own voice breaking into something I had never heard before.

By the time we rushed into the hospital, the night was already shifting shape.

The emergency lights felt like they were slicing the world open.
Nurses shouting, wheels rolling, people crying in languages I couldn’t understand.
They took her away from me, and I stood there useless, trembling, my breath catching like something was stuck in my chest.

“Stay awake,” the nurse said.
“Just stay awake till your father comes.”

She didn’t know that those words would become a curse.

I sat alone in the long corridor, my hands still sticky with her blood.
The clock above flickered from 1:59 to 2:00, but the minute didn’t feel real.
Time felt like a rubber band stretched too far.

When the first seizure hit me, I thought the hospital floor was rising to swallow me.
Lights twisted.
Air shook.
Something cold brushed the back of my neck.

And then—I saw it.

Or felt it.

A shape in the far corner of the corridor.
Standing.
Breathing.
Mirroring the way I sat.

Not a demon with teeth or fire.

A shadow with my posture, my tilted head, my shaking hands.
Like the darker version of myself had stepped out to watch me break.

I blinked and it vanished, but the feeling stayed, sitting heavily in the center of my ribs.

I fell forward.
My cheek hit the cold floor.

Someone lifted my head gently.
A palm, old and soft, smelling faintly of sandalwood.

“Drink,” a whisper said.

Water touched my lips.
It tasted like rain touching the first leaf of summer.

When I woke again, Appa was shouting — not loud, but in that pained, helpless way a father does when he’s scared.

“What happened to you? Why did you faint? Why were you alone?”

His voice trembled, and guilt crawled up my spine.
But even through the panic in his eyes, he looked at me strangely… as if something inside me had shifted.

As if I had returned from somewhere he could not follow.

The next morning, I felt it clearly.

The world was moving at the wrong speed.

Birds flapped slower.
People blinked slower.
My thoughts, though, ran ahead like they were chasing a distant storm.

I felt too aware.
Too awake.
Like I was carrying light in my chest that didn’t belong to me.

That was also the first morning I noticed this strange ache inside Appa’s eyes.
As if staying close to me was pulling something out of him.

As if my presence itself was a weight.

Like my mother’s death, which I never remembered but always felt, had stretched long fingers into the present.

A whisper inside me said:

“This demon… whatever it is…
it does not just feed on your sleep.
It steals pieces of souls around you.”

I didn’t know where that voice came from.

But it felt older than me.
Older than Appa.
Older than the wind moving through the trees outside our home.

That night, I could not sleep.

The shadow from the hospital stood again in my room —
closer this time
breathing with me
almost touching my shoulder.

And for the first time in my life,
I was afraid of my own mind.
