I had a math teacher who used to tell me ,”If the current steps are not leading to the answer, try altering the previous step so that you might get an different approach”,(because going all the way up from the current might be a waste of time). Later in life, I learnt it was ‘backtracking the steps’ and trying out a different approach. But in backtracking, the present steps will change once we backtrack.

I always wondered whether we could change the actions in the past so that the current course of actions make more sense to the future. It is impossible as far as I have put my mental efforts into this thought.

But this thought of changing the past that the present actions made more curious and made myself introduce to a new concept related time — Block Universe Theory.

The Block Universe theory suggests that the time is a dimension(4th dimension) and the past , present and future all exist simultaneously.

According to the theory, time do not flow , which means if we can perceive time as a fourth dimension, we could travel back and forth. There are several contradictions and paradoxes related with this theory. I did not delve into any of those contradictions much as I wanted to figure out the possibility of this in some way. I was thinking of movie scenes with similar moments and found a moment from Interstellar relating with this.

SPOILERS AHEAD* In the movie Interstellar, the protagonist Cooper an ex NASA Pilot gets a gravitational anomaly in his daughter bedroom that leds him to a secret mission by NASA to save earth by finding habitable planets outside. He leaves his daughter despite she rebelling his decision. Only after leaving, he realizes going back to earth is out of his reach and saving earth and his daughter is difficult. After failed tries he enters a tesseract inside a black hole. Inside it he would be able to perceive different moments in his daughter bedroom. He would be capable of travelling to and forth in the 4-dimension tesseract and witnessing various moments of his daughter life.

At first Cooper thinks of changing the past by sending his daughter signals in Morse code translating to ‘STAY’ when he is about to leave his daughter, yet the efforts go in vain. Then TARS, a tactical assistance bot tells Cooper that He is not here to change the past.Then Cooper realizes of what led him to here — Himself. Then he goes back and sends the gravitational anomalies in binary codes encoding the information of the secret NASA station leading himself to the secret mission.

I am unsure with my interpretation of this thought correlation with a physics theory and a science-fiction movie scene is proper. But I know there are similar patterns of models and analogies can be compared with this idea. I was thinking of how to apply this, at least in an abstract manner or through a thought experiment.

Consider our lives as a Chess game where each move you make is an action . For instance the flow of the game is not favorable to you as the opponent moves contradicts your approach. Suppose you had the ability to see with a different approach, not by changing the moves you did previously. Just by looking the moves you did with a different approach, the moves you just did might be better moves and even change the course of game. This analogy might sound silly while comparing with the events and life , I figured out by altering the narrative we have been telling ourselves about past actions, affect the present actions that it might get an entirely different perspective of the present..

By not physically changing the past or not giving to false narratives to make up with the mistakes(though it sounds more like it) but reinterpretation of events , their meanings might help us to make our current actions more logical and coherent to the future.

I wonder what people would do if they were inside a tesseract with the possibility of experiencing the time as the fourth dimension . What would you do ?
